Cōng yóu bǐng (*cong you bing* or *scallion pancakes*) are a savory, unleavened flatbread folded with oil and minced scallions (green onions). Cong you bing are typically shallow fried or grilled and served as both a street food and restaurant dish. In Taiwan, variaions include dàn bǐng (*egg pancakes*, commonly eaten for breakfast) and niúròu juǎnbǐng (*beef rolls*).
