Chòu dòufu (*stinky tofu*) is a fermented tofu popular as a street food in Taiwan. In night markets, stinky tofu is commonly served deep-fried and topped with pickled cabbage, but can also be eaten cold, steamed, or stewed. Traditionally prepared in a brine of fermented milk, vegetables, and meat for up to several months, stinky tofu is said to have an odor resembling that of rotten garbage or smelly feet.
