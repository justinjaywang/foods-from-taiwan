*Dòujiāng* (doujiang or soy milk) is a drink made from soybeans that are ground, boiled, and strained. Soybeans are central to East Asian cuisine, and soy milk is ubiquitous.

In Taiwan, both sweet and savory varieties are traditional breakfast fare, often accompanied by foods like shaobing (sesame flatbread), youtiao (deep-fried dough sticks), and [mantou](#m){: .js-nav-link} (steamed buns).
