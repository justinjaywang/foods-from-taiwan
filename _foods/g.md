Guàbāo (*pork belly buns* or ambiguously, *bao*) is a [xiaochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaochi) dish popular in Taiwan, traditionally consisting of braised pork belly sandwiched in a steamed bun and garnished with pickled mustard greens, fresh cilantro, crushed peanuts, and sugar.

<!--

also known as steamed bao[2], Taiwanese Hamburger[3], pork belly buns[4], or ambiguously, bao,[5][6] is a xiaochi dish originating from Fuzhou[7], the capital of Fujian province, with similar variants found across China, and a popular Taiwanese street food.

It consists of a slice of stewed meat and other condiments sandwiched between flat steamed bread known as lotus leaf buns. The lotus leaf bun is typically 6–8 centimetres (2.4–3.1 in) in size, semi-circular and flat in form, with a horizontal fold that, when opened, gives the appearance that it has been sliced. The traditional filling for gua bao is a slice of red-cooked porkbelly, typically dressed with stir-fried suan cai (pickled mustard greens), coriander, and ground peanuts.[6][8][9]


True Taiwanese pork belly buns have five defining components: the fluffy steamed bun, tender braised pork belly, pickled mustard greens, fresh cilantro, and powdered peanuts. All combined, it's a messy, colorful, glorious snack of salty, sweet, pungent, and fresh flavors, with multiple textures to boot.


This gave the Gua Bao a boost from being a simple dish known in Asia, to its cult-following in the West through street food vendors, renamed by many as the Taiwanese hamburger. Then, like a lot of North American trends, Europe followed some years after. After making the leap over the Atlantic, many restaurants have decided to serve the Gua Bao in its original form.
