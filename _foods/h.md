Huāshēng (*peanuts*) are widely used in Taiwanese cuisine in a variety of applications. They may be crushed and used as a garnish (as in [guabao](#g){: .js-nav-link}), sweetened and used as a dessert topping or filling, added to a stir-fry, blended into a sauce, or simply eaten on their own either roasted or boiled in-shell.
