Huāshēng (*peanuts*) are widely used in Taiwanese cuisine, in both sweet and savory contexts. They may be crushed and used as a garnish (as in <a href="#g" class="js-nav-link" data-target="g">guabao</a>), sweetened and used as a dessert topping or filling, added to a stir-fry, blended into a sauce, or eaten out-of-hand either roasted or boiled in-shell.
