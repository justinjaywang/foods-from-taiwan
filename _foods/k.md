Kǔguā (*bitter melon*) is a vegetable used in Asian cuisines, typically in stir-fries (often with pork and fermented black soybeans), stews and soups, and herbal teas. Bitter melon is valued for its extremely bitter flavor and health benefits.

Bitter melon is generally consumed cooked in the green or early yellowing stage. The young shoots and leaves of the bitter melon may also be eaten as greens.

In Chinese cuisine, bitter melon (Chinese: 苦瓜, pinyin: kǔguā or kugua) is valued for its bitter flavor, typically in stir-fries (often with pork and douchi), soups, dim sum, and herbal teas (gohyah tea). It has also been used in place of hops as the bittering ingredient in some beers in China and Okinawa.[3]


Bitter gourd, also known as bitter melon may not be commonly used in Western cuisine but it is very popular in Asian cuisines especially for its health benefits.

Why, then, eat such an offensively flavored melon? Precisely because its bitterness, at times almost unbearable, is unique and memorable. Many Asian culinary traditions, not to mention those in Central and South America, embrace bitter melon. The Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, Filipino, and so forth, counter the bitterness of the fruit with spicy, sweet, or savory components.
