Liánwù (*wax apple*, *lianwu*, literally: *lotus mist*) is a fruit native to Southeast Asia and found in the south of Taiwan. An apple by name only, the taste is mildly sweet and the inner flesh is juicy, crisp, light, and refreshing. This airy texture, along with their rarity (they are not widely cultivated due to their perishability), makes wax apples prized and truly unique.

<!-- 
- native to Southeast Asia
- thin, delicate skin
- Wax apple can host exotic fruit flies, so agricultural regulations prohibit its importation into the United States.
- but rarely found in US.
- looks like it was made of wax on outside
- inside is crisp but oddly spongy, juicy white flesh
- flavor slightly sweet, mild, refreshing
- crisp, refreshing, light
- liquid-to-flesh ratio of the wax apple is comparable to a watermelon
- the wax apple's flesh has a very loose weave
- The very middle holds a seed situated in a sort of cotton-candy-like mesh

The taste is light, sweet, but the texture is the strangest part. It seems as though the mountainous mist in which it was bathed crystolized into its present form-- something between styrofoam and cantaloupe.  A third of it seems to be air, and as that goes, you seem to be able to indefinitely eat them without getting too full, like a fruit from paradise that never becomes unsatisfying.
