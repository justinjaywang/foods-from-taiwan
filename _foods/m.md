Mántou (*mantou* or *Chinese steamed bun*) is a steamed bread eaten in Chinese cuisine. In northern parts of China where wheat, rather than rice, is grown, mantou is a staple food. In Taiwan, it is popular as a breakfast food or a portable snack or meal.

The term "mantou" refers to plain or unfilled buns, while bāozi (*baozi*) is a steamed bun with a savory or sweet filling.

I like mantou because they’re portable, easy to digest, and better when cold than rice! In the northern provinces of China, it’s a staple starch at every meal (it’s kind of equivalent to a dinner roll). As a southerner who usually reaches for rice instead, I’ve learned to really appreciate the versatilities of mantou. With a large batch in the freezer, I am never more than 10 minutes away from a complete meal. Not to mention, it’s so nice to change things up a bit from time to time.

Most people recognize the word “baozi,” but not “mantou.” If you’re not native to China, it’s pretty likely that you use the English word “bun” to cover a wide range of steamed or baked dough, but the description is more specific in Chinese. The word “mantou, 馒头” generally refers to steamed buns without filling. “Baozi, 包子” refers to steamed buns with filling like our Ginger Carrot Baozi pork buns. The baked buns with or without filling are what we call “mianbao, 面包.” You learn something new every day!

Baozi (Chinese: About this sound 包子), or bao, is a type of filled bun[1] or bread-like (i.e. made with yeast) dumpling in various Chinese cuisines. There are many variations in fillings (meat or vegetarian) and preparations (usually steamed). In its bun-like aspect it is very similar to the traditional Chinese mantou

often referred to as Chinese steamed bun, is a type of cloud-like steamed bread or bun popular in Northern China.[1] The name mantou is said to have originated from a tale about Zhuge Liang.[1]

Mantou are typically eaten as a staple food in northern parts of China where wheat, rather than rice, is grown. They are made with milled wheat flour, water and leavening agents. In size and texture, they range from 4 centimetres (1.6 in), soft and fluffy in the most elegant restaurants, to over 15 centimetres (5.9 in), firm and dense for the working man's lunch. As white flour, being more heavily processed, was once more expensive, white mantou were something of a luxury in pre-industrial China.

Traditionally, mantou, bing, and wheat noodles were the staple carbohydrates of the northern Chinese diet, analogous to rice, which forms the mainstay of the southern Chinese diet. They are also known in the south, but are often served as street food or a restaurant dish, rather than as a staple or home cooking. Restaurant mantou are often smaller and more delicate and can be further manipulated, for example, by deep frying and dipping in sweetened condensed milk.

They are often sold pre-cooked in the frozen section of Asian supermarkets, ready for preparation by steaming or heating in the microwave oven.

A similar food, but with a savory or sweet filling inside, is baozi.[2] Mantou is the older word, and in some regions (such as the Jiangnan region of China, and Korea) mantou (or the equivalent local reading of the word) can be used to indicate both the filled and unfilled buns, while in Japan the equivalent local reading of the word (manjū) refers only to filled buns.
