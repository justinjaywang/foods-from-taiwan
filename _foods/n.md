Beef noodle soup, often referred to as beef noodles, is a Chinese and Taiwanese noodle soup made of stewed or red braised beef, beef broth, vegetables and Chinese noodles. It exists in various forms throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia. Beef noodle soup was first created by the Hui people (a Chinese Muslim ethnic group) during the Tang Dynasty of China.[1][2]

n Taiwan, beef noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes, such as braised dried tofu, seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with suan cai (Chinese sauerkraut) on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as well.[3]

In Chinese, "牛肉麵" literally means "beef noodles".

In Taiwan, "牛肉麵" typically consists of either brisket or shank only, though many restaurants also have tendon or a more expensive option with both meat and tendon ("半筋半肉麵", literally "half tendon half meat noodle") and occasionally with tripe; 三寶麵, literally "three-treasure noodle", usually denotes a bowl containing all three.

In Taiwan, it is sometimes considered a national dish and every year the capital Taipei holds an annual Beef Noodle Festival, where various chefs and restaurants compete for the title of the "best beef noodles in Taiwan".[4][5] Due to influences from the influx of out of province Chinese from mainland China in the early 1900s, the Taiwanese version of beef noodle soup is now one of the most popular dishes in Taiwan.[6]


Prized as a national dish, Taiwanese beef noodle soup (niu rou mian) is deceptively complex and full of subtle nuance. A lot of work goes into perfecting the rich and savory beef broth, utilizing such ingredients as ginger, hot bean paste, dark and light soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, sesame oil and star anise. Either beef brisket or beef shank is typically stewed or red braised and the bowl should always arrive piping hot and with a side of pickled radish for crunch.

The best beef noodle soup is steaming, steaming, hot! Best in a bowl that is not too big nor too small. The broth should be a red bean paste color, and spicy chili oil should be floating on top of the broth in a shiny film. The fragrance should be of chili-spicy-bean-paste and, of course, stewed beef. And  chopped  garlic and green onions should be added to finish off my perfect bowl of beef noodle soup.

The perfect noodles are chewy and perfectly Q-Q!! (“Q-Q” is a frequently used phrase in Taiwanese to describe pleasantly chewy food items such as mochi)

No one used to think twice about niu rou mien. It was cheap, tasty, and convenient. Just like any fast food restaurant, you order, eat, and go. It’s just been over the past 10 years that the government has started to promote beef noodle soup as being something unique to Taiwan, as a method of gaining international attention, especially from Chinese tourists who love sampling Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which is why they started the International Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup competition. I think the popularity of the competition has definitely created a sense of pride and ownership over the unique 'Taiwanese-ness' of Taiwanese beef noodle soup.


If Taiwan has a national dish, it is beef noodle soup, which is found everywhere from night markets to traditional dining halls. At beef noodle soup shops, the vendors tend to their enormous cauldrons with great affection, as if raising a child. These are master soups that are never emptied, but only added to — more bones, more onions — to build on yesterday’s flavors. I love the idea of a broth that intensifies over time, the way a wok benefits from being properly seasoned over time and through use.

This Taiwanese version of the classic Chinese beef noodle soup is “red-braised” (slow-cooked in soy sauce).
