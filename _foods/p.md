Pái gǔ fàn (*pork chop rice*) is a Taiwanese dish consisting of marinated, deep-fried or braised pork chop served over rice. The pork chop is often served along with an array of side dishes as part of a bian dang (bento boxed lunch).

biandang (Taiwanese version of a bento)

We usually got this as part of a 'bian dang' or lunchbox from local vendors. The crispy coating on a soy, five-spice infused pork chop is da bomb. Traditionally served over steamed white rice, along with some soy-braised eggs (Lu Dan http://thegrubfiles.blogspot.com/2012/09/soy-braised-eggs-lu-dan-lo-nung.html) and Takuwan (preserved daikon radish).

The most popular lunch box meal in Taiwan is the Taiwanese Pork Chop Rice. There are two main varieties – the deep fried pork chop or the braised pork chop. I love the deep fried version because the crunchiness of the pork chop complements the soft fluffy rice so well. It’s so opposite yet so good together.


Pork chop over rice, or pai gu fan (排骨饭), though it may look fancy, is really Chinese cafeteria/street food. I mean that in the best way possible (as in street food in any culture is seriously some of the best food you can get). It consists of a marinated and fried pork chop, usually on the thinner side, sitting on top of some rice and ground pork sauce. It is often served with a side of pickled mustard greens and a tea egg.

Taiwanese Pork Chop Rice is basically a set meal of one piece of deep fried pork chop, a serving of rice with assorted vegetables toppings (cabbage is standard, as well as sour mustard green and pickles), and a small bowl of clear soup on the side.


‘Bian Dang’ (pronounced bee-Ann dung) is a Taiwanese bento box . This cultural phenomenon originated from Japan (bento). During the Japanese occupation in Taiwan, bento made its way into the Taiwanese people’s mouths and tummies (and hearts and minds) and its legacy has stayed in Taiwanese culture ever since.

Bian Dang is basically a recyclable paper box filled with steamed rice, vegetables and a protein. A simple home-style like meal that is important for adults and children alike. It’s sold ‘fresh and hot’ at many eateries and shops. Because it’s cheap and fast, it’s easy to just grab and go. Kind of like a healthier concept of fast food really.


Generally, there are three types of Pork Chop Bian Dang in Taiwan. All are different and delicious on their own.

The deep fried type.

The pan fried type.

The braised type.


Imagine a juicy, bone-in pork chop battered and then deep-fried to a dark golden crisp (not unlike the German schnitzel) served over a mound of soft, steamed rice with sour, pickled vegetables and a hard-boiled egg. That’s basically what pai gu fan is.

The dish has humble roots as a Taiwanese street food and is still quite popular to serve as a part of a bian dang, Taiwan’s version of a Japanese bento box or lunch box meal. Making pai gu fan at home is not particularly difficult, though I find it hard to master the crispiness of the mottled crust on the outside without a decent heating source (gas stove) and wok.


For while bian dang are found everywhere on the island, none are perhaps as beloved as those made for decades by the government-run Taiwan Railways Administration.

Some of the most homey dishes are the portable lunchboxes, or bian dang


I had encountered many side dishes placed in bian dang and you'll be surprised with their variety: from vegetables to noodles to scrap meat to proper meat, all of which are designed to complement both flavor and texture of the main viand.
