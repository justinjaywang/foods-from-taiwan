Qiū dāo yú (*mackerel pike*, *Pacific saury*, Japanese: *sanma*, literally: "autumn knife fish") is a fish used in Taiwanese cuisine but most notably in Japanese and Korean cuisines. It is often grilled whole, but can also be battered and deep-fried or braised.

The intestines are very bitter, but some people enjoy the taste and prefer to leave them in. Renowned Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu might've been one of those people—his 1962 film [*An Autumn Afternoon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Autumn_Afternoon) literally translates to "The Taste of Sanma."

Saury, or sanma, is one of the most prominent seasonal foods representing autumn in Japanese cuisine. It is most commonly served salted and grilled (broiled) whole, garnished with daikon oroshi (grated daikon) and served alongside a bowl of rice and a bowl of miso soup. Other condiments may include soy sauce, lime, lemon, or other citrus juices. The intestines are bitter, but many people choose not to gut the fish, as many say its bitterness, balanced by the condiments, is part of the enjoyment. Salt-grilled saury is also served in Korea, where it is known as kkongchi gui (꽁치구이).
