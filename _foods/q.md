Qiū dāo yú (*mackerel pike*, *Pacific saury*, Japanese: *sanma*, literally: "autumn knife fish") is a fish used in Taiwanese cuisine but most notably in Japanese and Korean cuisines. It is often grilled whole, but can also be battered and deep-fried or braised.

The intestines are very bitter, but some people enjoy the taste and prefer to leave them in. Renowned Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu might've been one of those people—his 1962 film [*An Autumn Afternoon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Autumn_Afternoon) literally translates to "The Taste of Sanma."
