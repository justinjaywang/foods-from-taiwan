is a Chinese rice dish that is commonly seen throughout Taiwan and Southern Fujian[1]. The flavor may vary from one region to another, but the basic ingredients remain the same: ground pork marinated and boiled in soy sauce served on top of steamed rice.


While Minced pork rice is an important icon in typical Taiwanese folk cuisine, the variety of methods to customize flavors is so wide that it creates considerable differences between regions. In southern Taiwan, where people name it by the sauce "bah-sò-pn̄g (肉燥飯)" instead of the meat, Minced pork rice is preferably served with pork with less fat. People in the north of Taiwan favor a greasier version of meat sauce with rice, sometimes even with glutinous rice mixed in.

In southern Taiwan, while "bah-sò-pn̄g" is seen on the menu indicating Minced pork rice, "ló͘-bah-pn̄g (滷肉飯)" remains on the very same menu, referring to another dish where braised pork belly covers the rice. The same rice with braised pork belly is known as "khòng-bah-pn̄g (焢肉飯)" in northern Taiwan.


Lu Ruo Fan(滷肉飯), or minced pork rice, is the ultimate comfort food. If there was ever a dish that captures the blue collar essence of Taiwanese food, lu rou fan would be it(although beef noodle soup would probably have something to say about that). Lu rou fan is a dish whose name is a dead giveaway on what it is – ground pork stewed in soy sauce and served over rice.


If you spend any time in Taiwan, you’ll quickly realize that one of the most simple and most locally loved dishes is lu rou fan (滷肉飯), the simple combination of rice topped with braised minced pork.

It can be served and eaten on its own as a complete dish, or it can be the base of a meal that includes a number of side dishes.

The pork was incredibly tender and just melted into the rice below it, with a blast of soothing slow braised Chinese soy sauce flavor to it, and just a hint of star anise and cinnamon.
