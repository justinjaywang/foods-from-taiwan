Ròu zào fàn (*minced pork rice*, *braised pork rice*, *rou zao fan*), widely called lu rou fan, is a classic Taiwanese rice dish consisting of ground pork or minced pork belly, braised slowly in soy sauce with fried shallots and other spices, served over rice. Lu rou fan is a staple of eateries and home kitchens alike, and is beloved as a comfort food. It can be eaten as a meal on its own or as the base of a meal that includes various other side dishes.
