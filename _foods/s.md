Sānbēijī (*sanbeiji*, literally: "three cup chicken") is a popular Taiwanese dish with roots in southern China. The dish derives its name from the equal parts of soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil used to cook the chicken (though many deviate from this 1:1:1 ratio).

is a popular chicken dish in Chinese cuisine. The dish originates from the Jiangxi province of southern China, and is a specialty of Ningdu. The dish has become especially popular in Taiwan, being introduced to the island by the Hakka people.

The dish derives its name from the three cups of sauces required. For each chicken, a cup each of soy sauce, rice wine (usually mijiu although it may be mixed with Shaoxing jiu), and sesame oil are added.

The chicken, together with the sauces, is cooked in an earthenware pot on high heat for ten minutes, then on low heat to allow the sauces to be absorbed by the meat. Sanbeiji is served with no sauce; the dish is cooked until all the sauce evaporates and is absorbed by the chicken. When it is served at the table, the chicken should be sizzling—even popping—on the cusp of burning. This gives the chicken a crisper texture (and richer flavor) unlike most other Chinese or Taiwanese stewed dishes. The dish is then eaten with either steamed rice or rice congee.


It is Taiwanese in origin, which is to say it is cooked across the island and wherever Taiwanese have landed after they’ve left. But like much Taiwanese cooking, the dish has roots in China.


“It’s a seminal dish,” Eddie Huang, the jocular restaurateur whose Taiwanese-American childhood in Orlando, Fla., is the subject of the ABC television comedy “Fresh Off the Boat,” told me when I called him. “You’ll be judged on it.” But its origin story, Huang cautioned, is a dangerous one. Cooking three-cup chicken with an equal ratio of oil and soy and rice wine leads to a greasy, unappetizing mess. “If you actually cook it that way, you’ll be in trouble,” he said. “The point is to draw the sugar out of all the ingredients using a little sesame oil, but not a lot.”


No two households make this dish the exact same way, but the basic recipe uses those three sauce ingredients to create a thick, dark, reduced syrup that absorbs right into the chicken. It’s a really easy recipe, because everything is pretty much chop and drop. It’s a one pot deal, and it comes together quicker than a kick in the pants.


San Bei Ji(三杯鷄), or Three Cup Chicken, is a classic Taiwanese dish made by cooking chicken with sesame oil, soy sauce and rice wine. The chicken is cooked in the sauce until tender before the sauce is reduced to a glaze that coats the chicken.

"One cup of each," says Sifton, before going on to explain that, while family recipes in Taiwan vary, few people make sanbeiji according to the 1 cup : 1 cup : 1 cup legend. (For you, that means you can put those bottles you've invested in toward multiple meals.)
