Shìzi (*persimmon*) is a fruit native to China, in season from September to January in Taiwan. There are two types, astringent and non-astringent. Astringent varieties, like the heart-shaped Hachiya, are often dried and eaten as a snack or used to make drinks or desserts. Non-astringent varieties like the fuyu (pictured) may be eaten fresh while still very firm and remain edible when soft.
