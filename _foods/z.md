Zòngzi (*zongzi* or *sticky rice dumplings*) are a traditional Chinese food made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings, wrapped in bamboo leaves and boiled or steamed. Traditionally eaten during the [Duanwu Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival){: target="_blank"} (Dragon Boat Festival), they can now be found year-round and include savory or sweet fillings that vary by region. Taiwan-style zongzi can include salted duck eggs, pork belly, peanuts, dried shrimp, and shiitake mushrooms.

The fillings for zongzi in mainland China’s Huzhou city, for example, are simply chunks of pork or some sweetened bean paste, while a Taiwan-style zongzi may include chestnuts, dried mushrooms, shrimp, salted duck egg yolks, peanuts and pork.

Fillings for zongzi vary in different regions of China. For example, in southern China, zongzi is savory, and filled with shredded pork or chicken, salted duck egg, taro, or shiitake mushrooms. Zongzi in northern China usually contain jujube, preserved fruit, taro, cooked peanuts, or tapioca. These fillings are sweet, and thus zongzi is eaten as a dessert. The shape also varies from region to region; northern zongzi are tetrahedral, while the southern variety are conical [1].

They are cooked by steaming or boiling.[3] In the Western world, they are also known as rice dumplings or sticky rice dumplings.

Zongzi (sticky rice dumplings) are traditionally eaten during the Duanwu Festival (Dragon Boat Festival), which falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar[2][4] (approximately late-May to mid-June).

A popular belief amongst the Chinese of eating zongzi involved commemorating the death of Qu Yuan, a famous Chinese poet from the kingdom of Chu who lived during the Warring States period.[2] Known for his patriotism, Qu Yuan tried unsuccessfully to warn his king and countrymen against the expansionism of their Qin neighbors. When the Qin general Bai Qi took Yingdu, the Chu capital, in 278 BC, Qu Yuan's grief was so intense that he drowned himself in the Miluo river after penning the Lament for Ying. According to legend, packets of rice were thrown into the river to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body.[2][5]

Although they may have originally been a seasonal food, zongzi are available year-round in most major cities with a significant Chinese population.

The shapes of zongzi vary,[6] and range from being approximately tetrahedral in southern China to an elongated cone in northern China. Wrapping zongzi neatly is a skill that is passed down through families, as are the recipes. Making zongzi is traditionally a family event of which everyone helps out.

The fillings used for zongzi vary from region to region, but the rice used is almost always glutinous rice (also called "sticky rice" or "sweet rice"). Depending on the region, the rice may be lightly precooked by stir-frying or soaked in water before using. In the north, fillings are mostly red bean paste and tapioca or taro. Northern style zongzi tend to be sweet[11] and dessert-like. Southern-style zongzi, however, tend to be more savory or salty.[11] Fillings of Southern-style zongzi include salted duck egg, pork belly, taro, shredded pork or chicken, Chinese sausage, pork fat, and shiitake mushrooms.

Zongzi (粽子) is a traditional Chinese food. It consists of sticky or glutinous rice which is wrapped in bamboo leaves, then steamed or boiled. Recipes are passed down through generations, as is the skill of neatly wrapping the rice with bamboo, and families will often all help out with the preparation of this food. Fillings for zongzi vary in different regions of China. For example, in southern China, zongzi is savory, and filled with shredded pork or chicken, salted duck egg, taro, or shiitake mushrooms. Zongzi in northern China usually contain jujube, preserved fruit, taro, cooked peanuts, or tapioca. These fillings are sweet, and thus zongzi is eaten as a dessert. The shape also varies from region to region; northern zongzi are tetrahedral, while the southern variety are conical [1].

Zongzi are most commonly wrapped in bamboo leaves, but sometimes lotus leaves, maize leaves, banana leaves, or other types are used instead. Each different type of leaf, though not eaten as a part of the meal, gives a unique flavor to the rice, as well as a distinct scent. Rice is another staple in this recipe; sticky rice, specifically, is always used [2]. Peanuts are just one of many potential fillings, as previously mentioned. However, peanuts are extremely popular in China, and the country is one of the top producers of peanuts in the world today, so this ingredient warranted inclusion.

Zongzi’s recipe is deeply ingrained in China’s history and cultural practices. Not only is it a staple treat in homes across China and Southeast Asia, it is also integral to Duanwujie (端午节), the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival. Traditionally, the annual festival’s most celebratory component has been racing different villages’ colorful boats resembling dragons against each other [3]. In addition, preparing and eating zongzi during the festival complements the races by connecting the Chinese people with their rich heritage and age-old traditions.
