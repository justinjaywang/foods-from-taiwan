Zòngzi (*zongzi* or *sticky rice dumplings*) are a traditional Chinese food made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings, wrapped in bamboo leaves and boiled or steamed. Traditionally eaten during the [Duanwu Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival){: target="_blank"} (Dragon Boat Festival), they can now be found year-round and include savory or sweet fillings that vary by region. Taiwan-style zongzi can include salted duck eggs, pork belly, peanuts, dried shrimp, and shiitake mushrooms.
