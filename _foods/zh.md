are the edible shoots (new bamboo culms that come out of the ground) of many bamboo species including Bambusa vulgaris and Phyllostachys edulis. They are used as vegetables in numerous Asian dishes and broths. They are sold in various processed shapes, and are available in fresh, dried, and canned versions.

Shoots of several species of bamboo are harvested for consumption

In certain parts of Japan, China and Taiwan, shoots from the giant timber bamboo Bambusa oldhamii are harvested in spring or early summer. Young shoots from this species are highly sought after due to their crisp texture and sweet taste.[5] Older shoots, however, have an acrid flavor and should be sliced thin and boiled in a large volume of water several times. The sliced bamboo is edible after boiling. B. oldhamii is more widely known as a noninvasive landscaping bamboo.

Pickled bamboo, used as a condiment, may also be made from the pith of the young shoots.

Spring holds a special place in Taiwanese cuisine; that's when the local delicacy of fresh, young bamboo shoots are ready for harvest, and if you've only eaten the canned stuff, you'll be blown away by shoots that are at once sweet, crunchy, nutty, and creamy. The same goes for young sugarcane, or the hyper-regional greens specific to certain mountain villages. Even plain old cabbage, when grown in the misty hill country, tastes better here; high-elevation mountain farmland means that cabbage and other produce grows slowly and fights for every concentrated nutrient it can muster.

By and large, the produce dishes you'll find are pretty simple; vegetables this good don't need much fussing. So keep an eye out for cold, minimally dressed salads, or simple stir fries, like plate above of mountain greens gussied up with sweet-and-sour pickled berries, tiny dried fish, hot chilies, and plenty of garlic.


Bamboo shoots grow in spring and winter. Spring bamboo shoots grow sometime between March to June. They are known for having sweet tips.

On the other hand, winter bamboo shoots are dug out from the ground. These are typically used for making canned bamboo shoots.
