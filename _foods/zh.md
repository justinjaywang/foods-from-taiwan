Zhúsǔn (*bamboo*)

<!-- 

Spring holds a special place in Taiwanese cuisine; that's when the local delicacy of fresh, young bamboo shoots are ready for harvest, and if you've only eaten the canned stuff, you'll be blown away by shoots that are at once sweet, crunchy, nutty, and creamy. The same goes for young sugarcane, or the hyper-regional greens specific to certain mountain villages. Even plain old cabbage, when grown in the misty hill country, tastes better here; high-elevation mountain farmland means that cabbage and other produce grows slowly and fights for every concentrated nutrient it can muster.

By and large, the produce dishes you'll find are pretty simple; vegetables this good don't need much fussing. So keep an eye out for cold, minimally dressed salads, or simple stir fries, like plate above of mountain greens gussied up with sweet-and-sour pickled berries, tiny dried fish, hot chilies, and plenty of garlic.
