Pinyin (also called the Chinese phonetic alphabet) is a system for transcribing Chinese using the Roman alphabet. Each of its 21 "initial" letters is presented here with a corresponding food found in Taiwan.

Influenced by the various people that have inhabited the island over the course of several centuries (most notably the Chinese, Japanese, and indigenous peoples) as well as geographic factors (seafood is plentiful and a wide range of fruits and vegetables are grown), Taiwanese cuisine is a blend of styles and innovations. The foods showcased provide an overview of some common ingredients and dishes.
