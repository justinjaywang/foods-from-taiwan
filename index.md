#### Introduction

Pinyin, also called the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, is a romanization system for Mandarin Chinese. Each of the alphabet's twenty-one initial letters is presented here with a corresponding food from Taiwan.

Influenced by the various people that have inhabited the island over several centuries (most notably the Chinese, Japanese, and indigenous peoples) as well as geographic factors (seafood is plentiful, a wide range of fruits and vegetables are grown), Taiwanese cuisine is a blend of styles and innovations.

The showcased foods provide an overview of common ingredients and dishes. Though not every food originated in Taiwan, all have been embraced over the years by the island's food-obsessed populace.
