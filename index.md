#### Introduction

Pinyin, also called the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, is a romanization system for Mandarin Chinese. Each of the alphabet's twenty-one initial letters is presented here with a corresponding food from Taiwan.

Influenced by the various people that have inhabited the island over several centuries (most notably the Chinese, Japanese, and indigenous peoples) as well as geographic factors (location and climate mean plentiful seafood and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables), Taiwanese cuisine is a diverse blend of styles.

The foods showcased are limited in number, but provide a reprentative overview of common ingredients and flavors. Though not every food necessarily originated in Taiwan, all have been embraced over the years by the island's food-obsessed populace.

Fine, here’s another shot: Taiwanese food is a blend of cuisines, thanks to waves of immigration to this mountainous, leaf-shaped island over several hundred years. The people who arrived from China’s coastal Fujian province starting in the 17th century get credit for bringing everything from noodles to fish balls.

The Japanese, who colonized Taiwan from 1895 until World War II ended in 1945, left their mark with sushi, tempura, and izakaya-style fare. The end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 brought as many as 2 million refugees (and their cooking styles) from all over the mainland—Shanghai, Sichuan, Shandong, and even some places that don’t start with “S.”

And let’s not forget the aboriginal peoples who’ve been on the island for thousands of years, mastering the use of its flora (bamboo shoots in a dozen varieties, mountain vegetables rarely seen elsewhere) and fauna (from wild boar to obscure shellfish). Taiwanese cuisine is like a dozen in one—which does not make it easy selling it to a public that often confused.

“Taiwanese food is a blend of flavours and innovation. Due to Taiwan’s history with a few different foreign influences that occupied the island and always enforced there traditions on the island.

There is no one short sentence to describe Taiwanese food. It’s versatile, colorful, beautiful and influenced by the rich history and geographical location of Taiwan. Taiwanese love their food, the common greeting in Taiwan is not “How are you?” instead, “Are you full yet?” (呷飽未?) is the choice of greeting.


Traditionally it has a strong base in Chinese flavours but with its geographical location freshness and availability is key. In a personal view with the history of Taiwan and political regime at times causing in balance, making the most of what you have and creating as many flavours and dishes as possible is also important. Restaurants called “quick fry or hot fry”(快炒/熱炒), where most dishes are only a few US dollars and you share all the flavours and dishes “family style”. This is where also traditional hot pot and soup-based dishes are so important and also local comfort food and available all year round and full of strong broths and stewed meats. Also, the influence of fresh seafood and how it is prepared is very strongly Japanese and more available than red meats (compared to the west).

With its geographical location every year Taiwan is battered with typhoons and earthquakes constantly challenging the farmers and their crops. Due to this constant survival and change, the local delicacies and food options are very seasonal. When in season produce is celebrated strongly and almost create a craze as favourite foods become available and in abundance so prices are fair.

In the west, we have become used to having food available to us from all the world constantly. Taiwan has an aspect of that as entrepreneurs are building new businesses bringing in new products. But it really is a country where the weather or trade agreements really affect your daily life and not just a report on the news with no immediate impact on your day.”
